That's great! Since you already know JavaScript, learning React will be much smoother. Hereâ€™s a roadmap and the prerequisites to get started with React:

## **Prerequisites for Learning React**
Before diving into React, make sure you're comfortable with:
1. **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
   - let, const (block-scoped variables)  
   - Arrow functions  
   - Template literals  
   - Destructuring  
   - Spread & Rest operators  
   - Promises & Async/Await  
   - Modules (import/export)  

2. **HTML & CSS**  
   - Flexbox & Grid  
   - CSS Modules or SCSS  
   - Basic understanding of responsive design  

3. **JavaScript Concepts Related to React**  
   - DOM Manipulation  
   - Event Handling  
   - Higher-Order Functions  
   - Callbacks & Closures
